+ Hello stranger! Welcome to my website :)
+ I am a third-year post-graduate student in DrugAI Group at Hunan University, focusing on deep generative models like VAEs, GANs, RNNs, and Flow for de novo molecular design. My supervisor is Professor [Xiangxiang Zeng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B20HBMIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Bosheng Song](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=n2szdRoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Prior to this, I acquired my Bachelor Degree in Anhui University of Science and Technology.
